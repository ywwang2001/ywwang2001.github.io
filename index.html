    		<h2 onclick="toggleSection(this)">About</h2>
    		<div class="section-content">
    		   	<p>I’m a builder of business and software based in New York, focusing on turning ideas into working systems.</p>
		</div>

    		<h2 onclick="toggleSection(this)">Early Years</h2>
    		<div class="section-content">
			<h3>Middle School</h3>
    		   	<p>Grow up in Shanghai, I was one of those kids in middle school who couldn't sit still—constantly getting called to the principal's office for disrupting class or running little side hustles. At one point, I was selling jailbroken iPhone apps to classmates and making more money than a 13-year-old should have. When I was 15, my parents decided I needed a change of scenery and shipped me off to a tiny academy in the suburbs outside Denver.</p>
    		   	 
    		   	<h3>High School</h3>
    		   	<p>High school was like landing on a different planet. Picture this overweight Chinese kid who learned English from textbooks, suddenly dropped into a school where everyone knew each other since kindergarten and youth group ran the social scene. I spent that first year mostly confused and homesick. But something shifted junior year—I got serious about basketball and soccer, not because I had natural talent, but because I needed to prove that I could reshape myself through sustained effort. I spent hours running after school, eating tons of Jimmy John's sandwiches with no sauce, and lost 30 kilograms within a year. I started paying attention in school, running for student government treasurer as I developed an interest in finance.</p>
    		   	 
    		   	<h3>College</h3>
    		   	<p>College was where I discovered how fast money can be made—and lost. The following was a progression of discoveries after I rushed to open my first investment account at 18.</p>
    		   	<ol style="margin-left: 2em;">
    		   	        <li><b>Dividends</b>: my first discovery—bought Macy’s stock and learned I could get paid simply for holding shares.</li>
    		   	        <li><b>Crypto</b>: sold the “boring” dividend stocks, convinced Bitcoin moved faster and promised more.</li>
    		   	        <li><b>Trading</b>: grew tired of waiting, watched YouTube gurus preach technical analysis, and spent entire days staring at price movements, searching for patterns that didn’t exist.</li>
    		   	        <li><b>Leverage</b>: my biggest discovery—felt like pulling money out of thin air, a thrill I still remember. I traded with 10x as standard, sometimes 20x, until a minor market whipsaw wiped out my account on a random Tuesday. I was traveling that night with a packed itinerary—the entire trip just froze the moment I received the margin call. I didn't bother going to the hotel—just slept in the car.</li>
    		   	        <li><b>Options</b>: discovered a few months later, thought they could get my money back. Not surprisingly, 100x leverage imploded even faster.</li>
		   	</ol>

		   	<p>The pattern repeated until I found a book called "Optimal Mean Reversion Trading" on one innocuous afternoon in junior year. When I opened it, I felt like reading something written by aliens—page after page of mathematical equations that might as well have been hieroglyphics. But I had this feeling that maybe this was the secret sauce—understanding this level of mathematics would separate actual traders from gamblers. My parents thought that I'd lost my mind when I added a mathematics minor halfway through college, but I knew my foundation was too shaky for what I was trying to accomplish.</p>
    		   	 
    		   	<h3>Graduate School</h3>
    		   	<p>Graduate school helped things click into place. Watching classmates compete for the same finance internships made me realize how saturated that path had become. As someone who'd always been more comfortable thinking through problems alone than networking at career fairs, the emergence of LLMs was a game-changer. I spent months in late-night conversations with LLMs, bouncing around ideas about career paths and industry trends. During one session—probably my hundredth hour of rambling about what to do with my life—skilled trades came up.</p>

		<h2 onclick="toggleSection(this)">Principles</h2>
    		<div class="section-content">
    		    <h3>The Axiom</h3>
		    <p>People center their lives around money, status, relationships, and experiences—then wonder why satisfaction never lasts. One gets the thing, feels good briefly, then before long is back where they started. Psychologists call this hedonic adaptation. I watched this pattern in myself and others enough times to realize something was fundamentally wrong with the approach. To build a good life, I need something foundational I can reason from—in mathematics we call these axioms. Here's mine: happiness comes from within. If I seek contentment by acquiring externalities, I've set myself up for a treadmill—brief happiness when I do, then hedonic adaptation pulls me back down, unhappy most of the time.</p>
    		    
    		    <h3>The Implementation</h3>
    		    <p>How do I find inner peace? The answer starts with a constraint—one cannot build contentment without meeting basic needs. After graduating, I stripped life down to components—food, shelter, financial stability—and optimized each. I learned to cook meals in batches, skateboarded to work, slept on a shikibuton that retracts during the day, fix my own things and build my own website (like this one). Now I build equity through stable work as an electrician while saving aggressively until passive income covers my basic needs. More importantly, I am finding inner peace through meditation—learning to be happy with just my basic needs met is a battle I have to win in my own mind. Only after finding inner contentment may I move on to the next question.</p>
    		    
    		    <h3>The Purpose</h3>
		    <p>What do I want to do with my life? Everyone has different answers. Here's mine: I want to create value—through entrepreneurship and investment. The most valuable lesson from my early trading years wasn’t about emotional control or technical analysis—it was the realization that wealth accumulation and dissipation are explosive in nature. It doesn’t grow linearly with effort but moves in sudden, disproportionate jumps to those who are positioned correctly. It runs contrary to standard corporate belief—do X amount of work with Y amount of wage, receive XY amount of pay, repeat. Asymmetric innovation is the key to value creation—a hundred men can’t push what one engine moves. Mathematics—despite being called boring or impractical—is actually among the quickest and most reliable way to compound intelligence. Each hour of study upgrades mental frameworks that can generate insights orders of magnitude more valuable than performing labor. One clear, correct idea can outweigh years of incremental busyness.</p>

		    <h3>The Strategy</h3>
    		    <p>Given that, the next move is to anchor my life in a career that provides financial stability to meet basic needs while preserving mental bandwidth for deep, compounding work. Skill trades—electrician, HVAC, carpenter, plumber—fit that profile—steady income, non-sedentary lifestyle, and freedom from office politics and social signaling expectation.</p>

    		    <h3>The Counterarguments</h3>
		    <p>Why not just hire talented people and let them do the thinking? Because talent only compounds under the right judgment. Business success fundamentally depends on employee effort—but that effort is shaped by leadership. An incompetent leader can’t distinguish high-cognitive builders from performers. The bad employee moves pieces around, optimizing quarterly KPIs while sacrificing long-term sustainability; the good employee often shows worse short-term metrics because they invest in research and development. When the leader rewards the wrong one, the system turns against itself—good workers leave from lack of recognition while bad ones thrive. Competent leaders attract intelligent workers who stay for purpose even with less pay. Incompetent ones drive them away, even with higher offers. Cognitive ability, it turns out, is one thing money cannot buy.</p>

    		    <h3>The Future</h3>
    		    <p>I can't specify where I will be taking my business. That's by design—you can't ask someone who hasn't run a marathon what they saw on the course. What I do know is that finding inner peace and making mathematics my priority might be the optimal path forward. My generation—Gen Z—stands at a unique inflection point in human history. Over the coming decades, advances in biotechnology—synthetic organs, gene therapies, and cellular regeneration—will likely extend average human lifespans beyond 90. By 2100, neuroscientists may develope brain-computer interfaces capable of transferring consciousness to non-biological substrates, allowing human to inhabit physical (humanoid robot) or digital forms indefinitely. I don't see that as science fiction but as the logical outcome of exponential progress already underway. This realization shapes how I plan—preparing for a life that could span centuries.</p>
