<h2 onclick="toggleSection(this)">Early Years</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>Thanks for stopping by. I was one of those kids in middle school in Shanghai who couldn't sit still, constantly getting called to the principal's office for disrupting class or running little side hustles. Selling jailbroken iPhone apps to classmates, making more money than I should have. When I was fifteen, my parents decided I needed a change of scenery and shipped me off to a tiny Adventist academy in the suburbs outside Denver.</p>
        
        <p>High school was like landing on a different planet. Picture this overweight Chinese kid who learned English from textbooks, suddenly dropped into a school where everyone knew each other since kindergarten and youth group was the main social event. I spent that first year mostly confused and homesick. But something shifted junior year - I got serious about basketball and soccer, not because I had natural talent, but because I discovered I could deliberately reshape myself through sustained effort. Spent hours running after school, eating loads of Jimmy John's sandwiches with no sauce, lost sixty pounds within a year. Started paying attention in classes, ran for student government treasurer as I developed an interest in finance.</p>
        
        <p>College was where I discovered I could lose money faster than I ever imagined. Right after turning eighteen, I opened my first investment account and bought Macy's stock because I liked their dividend yield. Then Bitcoin started exploding and I got completely hooked. Back then, brokerage platforms only gave you charts with no news feeds, so I'd spend entire days staring at price movements, trying to decode patterns that didn't exist. Started watching YouTube trading gurus who made it look easy and convinced myself this could become a career.</p>
        
        <p>I got accounts on crypto exchanges, found myself checking Bitcoin prices on my phone while walking to class, during lectures, basically every free moment. Then one random Tuesday my account got completely wiped out - no major news, no obvious reason, just got too aggressive with leverage and the market whipsawed. That should have been my wake-up call, but instead I discovered futures and options trading. Thought I could make back my losses faster with /ES contracts and 0DTE options. Accounts got wiped out even quicker - turns out adding time decay and complexity to an already losing strategy doesn't improve results.</p>
        
        <p>The pattern repeated through sophomore and junior year. Small wins followed by complete wipeouts. Each time convinced myself I'd figured it out, each time proved I hadn't. Junior year I found a book called "Optimal Mean Reversion Trading" and when I opened it, felt like I was reading something written by aliens. Page after page of mathematical equations that might as well have been hieroglyphics. But I had this feeling that maybe this was the secret sauce, that understanding this level of mathematics separated actual traders from gamblers like me. My parents thought I'd lost my mind when I added a mathematics minor halfway through college, but I knew my foundation was too shaky for what I was trying to accomplish. Started working through discrete mathematics textbooks in the library, slowly filling gaps that should have been covered years earlier.</p>
        
        <p>Graduate school helped things click into place. Watching classmates compete for the same finance internships made me realize how saturated that path had become. As someone who's always been more comfortable thinking through problems alone than networking at career fairs, the emergence of LLMs was a game-changer. I'd spend hours in late-night conversations with LLMs, bouncing ideas around about career paths, industry trends, anything really. During one of these sessions - probably my hundredth hour of rambling about what to do with my life - skilled trades came up. Started digging into electrician wages, job market data, the whole industry structure. The same supply and demand principles I'd learned losing money in trading were showing up everywhere - except this time pointing toward actual opportunity rather than overcrowded markets.</p>

<h2 onclick="toggleSection(this)">Principles</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
	<p>People center their lives around money, status, relationships, and experiences - then wonder why satisfaction never lasts. You get the thing, feel good briefly, adapt back to baseline. Psychologists call this hedonic adaptation. I watched this pattern in myself and others enough times to realize something fundamental was wrong with the approach.</p>

	<p>To think clearly about building a life, I need somewhere to start from, something foundational I can reason from - in mathematics we call these axioms. Here's mine: happiness comes from within, not from money or status or experiences or any of that. Build your contentment around acquiring external things and you've set yourself up for a treadmill - brief spikes when you gain them, then adaptation pulls you back down, so you need bigger hits to feel the same satisfaction.</p>
        
        <p>How do I find inner peace? The answer starts with a hard constraint - you can't build contentment on unmet needs. Basic necessities come first. So the practical question becomes: what does meeting those needs actually cost? The first couple years after graduation, I stripped life down to components and optimized each one. I learned to cook meals in batches, lived in the city with minimal commute, walked or skateboarded to work, slept on a shikibuton that retracts during the day, fixed my own things and built my own website (like this one). Do this honestly - no pretending, no forcing - and a baseline emerges: the actual cost of meeting human needs stripped of social pressure and status signaling. Now I am building equity through stable work as an electrician and disciplined saving until passive income covers it. Then I plan to live at that level for a couple years, testing whether contentment holds with just necessities met. Only after proving the axiom in practice does the next question matter.</p>
        
        <p>What do I want to do with my life? Everyone has different answers - this is mine. I want to create value. In capitalism, wealth measures value creation - imperfectly, but reliably enough. The next phase is building as much equity as possible over a lifetime by taking calculated risks where exceptional worldview and knowledge create an edge. The sequence matters: secure inner happiness first, pursue whatever matters to me second. Reverse it and I'm back on the hedonic treadmill - chasing dreams or other externalities to find happiness.</p>
        
        <p>How do I build as much equity as possible? This is where years of trading losses taught me something useful. Watching accounts swing from $25k to over $250k then back to zero within a month, repeatedly - the lesson wasn't about emotional toughness or reading charts. The lesson was this: wealth accumulation and dissipation are explosive in nature. Money flows extremely quickly at the right time to the right person - not through luck but through offering massive value at the exact moment the market needs it.</p>
        
        <p>How do I position myself to capture that flow? I need exceptional understanding of how the world actually works - not surface patterns but deep structures. The person who delivers massive value at the right moment sees what others miss because they understand the underlying machinery. I find studying mathematics is the fastest way to upgrade my mental framework. Not to impress anyone - honestly, studying abstract math creates more social friction than admiration. The point is rewiring how I think. Take Cantor's proof that some infinities are bigger than others - between 0 and 1 there are more numbers than all counting numbers extending to infinity. Once you internalize this, really understand why it's true, something shifts. You see hierarchical impossibilities everywhere: no algorithm can capture all market patterns because the pattern space is fundamentally larger than any enumeration. Some problems aren't just hard - they exist in a space my current methods can't even access.</p>

	<p>Why not join the corporate world, a hedge fund, or a startup? From what I've observed, most corporate workers become cogs in a machine. They're often filtered by sunk cost - years in college, internships, interview prep, hundreds of resumes sent. Their training typically optimizes for using existing frameworks and tools without friction, maximizing productivity given predefined objectives. When you prove you've sacrificed years doing pedigree activities, you signal that you've invested too much to quit, too much to think freely, too much to rebel. That's generally what companies want. Inside these institutions, I'd likely become the target of optimization and micromanagement, leaving little bandwidth for personal growth.</p>

	<p>Why not run a startup and hire mathematicians and programmers? This is where many get it wrong. Business success ultimately depends on how much time and energy employees invest. The ideal company has 100 employees who treat it like family, work 12 hours daily because they want to, interests fully aligned. The worst has 100 employees quiet quitting, playing politics, extracting maximum benefits while contributing minimum effort. What causes this divergence? Leader competence. A non-technical leader in a tech company can't distinguish good from bad employees. The bad employee optimizes current quarter earnings and KPIs while sacrificing long-term sustainability - moving pieces around without creating value. The good employee builds for long-term prosperity, often with worse KPIs because they're investing in real value creation through coding and collaboration. An incompetent boss rewards the wrong people. Let's assume the axiom: employees value recognition over compensation. Even well-paid talent leaves when unrecognized. Result: competent leaders attract good employees willing to take less pay to build something meaningful together. Incompetent leaders struggle to acquire talent even with high offers. Who wins?</p>

	<p>I can't specify where I will be taking my business. That's by design - you cannot ask someone who has never programmed before to describe what they would build. But what I do know is that my career as electrician fits perfectly: steady income, physical labor that preserves mental bandwidth. Daily mathematical study for at least an hour, building new cognitive architecture proof by proof. The bet: fundamentally different thinking yields fundamentally different results.</p>
